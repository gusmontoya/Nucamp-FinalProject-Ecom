   ## ‚ú® Padilla E-commerce Store Website ‚ö°Ô∏è

   Welcome!

My Padilla E-commerce site was built groundup by me.

<!-- ## What I Changed

  - Added external Link buttons to the top and bottom of the site
  - Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section
  - Added a new section for skills and changed section order (this messed with the original formatting quite a bit)
  - Built a Contact Form and integrated email notifications through Netlify
  - Swapped project images for iframes with project demo videos on YouTube
  - Skills feature: I built a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor
    hovers or clicks. The burger images were created in photoshop. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a
    sibling div (position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that 
    div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img
    and skills set. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation. My favorite part of the site. üòä

 ## What I Learned
  
    - Fine tuning CSS even more
    - Learned how to use React Hooks
    - Organization of files/folders
    - Deployed a site to Netlify (On to DO LIST)
