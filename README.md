   ## ‚ú® Padilla E-commerce Store Website ‚ö°Ô∏è

   Welcome!

My Padilla E-commerce site was built groundup by me.

<!-- ## What I Changed

  - Added external Link buttons to the top and bottom of the site
  - Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section
  - Added a new section for skills and changed section order (this messed with the original formatting quite a bit)
  - Built a Contact Form and integrated email notifications through Netlify
  - Swapped project images for iframes with project demo videos on YouTube
  - Skills feature: I built a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor
    hovers or clicks. The burger images were created in photoshop. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a
    sibling div (position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that 
    div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img
    and skills set. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation. My favorite part of the site. üòä

 ## What I Learned
  
    - Fine tuning CSS even more
    - Learned how to use React Hooks
    - Organization of files/folders
    - Deployed a site to Netlify (On to DO LIST)

## Thanks

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
